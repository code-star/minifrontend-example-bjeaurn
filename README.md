Maybe we can define a R&D question like 'who can micro frontend contribute/add more valure to user experience/data driven solutions/maintainability (in combination with a microservices/distributed architecture)?

What sub questions need to be answered to have a valuated opinion on this?

And how can we distribute (parts of) this opinion to the community of developers and our potential customers?

 [ ] Main question: What is the added value of Microfrontends in a Microservices architecture
 [ ] What is the added value of Microfrontends within the Codestar (FRP) stack?
 [ ] What effects does Microfrontends have on maintainability, ease of modification(?), autonomy(?), re-use, performance
